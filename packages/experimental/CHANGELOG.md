### Backlog

- Item models (properties and data).
- Party properties (via special item).
- Ensure streams are closed when objects are destroyed (on purpose or on error); error handling. Asserts vs Errors?
- Reactive components (Database, Party, Item, Model) with event propagation.
- Event handlers: global state to warn of leaks when system shuts down (show graph).

### Clean-up

- Pipeline logging/metrics.
- Consistent async functions (latch, trigger, etc.)
- WRN model/item formats.
- Rewrite FeedStore (remove hypertrie, path, etc.)
