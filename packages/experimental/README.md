# ECHO Experimental

## Next

- Stream loggers.

- Reactive components (Database, Party, Item, Model) with event propagation.
- Event handlers: global state to warn of leaks when system shuts down (show graph).
- Ensure streams are closed when objects are destroyed (on purpose or on error).
- Consistent async functions (latch, trigger, etc.)
